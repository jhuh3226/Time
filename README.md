**Sense of Time**

It's a clock not moving in real-time but needs a person to guess the time. It is placed in places where people have less exposure of the time (or real clock) and asks the person " what's the time?". 

The guessing of time is where this clock is mostly focused on. To guess the time, a person has to look back at things one has done, compare that moment with the data pool and experience one has, and calculate the time based on one's own reasons and data. We are not passively realizing the time, but as we guess, we are actively owning the time.
